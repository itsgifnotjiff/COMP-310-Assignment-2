I developed this on a Linux Ubuntu 19.10 system using the starter code of the proffesor posted in myCourses. I know that the code does not work but I have asked the proffesor for an extension (waiting response). If you care to look through the code you will notice that I understand the logic but even with some help from TAs , tutors at Trotier 3090 and Julie ( a student ) I was unable to debug it in time. I am submitting this with the hope that I get partial marks or a chance to continue working on it. I understand the theory behind it, it's just that I was unable to implement it in time due to my midterms , other assignments , the poor TAs who are overloaded and could not get to me and the fact that the starter code was posted late. Hopefully there is a compromise to be made.
